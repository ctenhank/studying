# Building NAS Server 

## Motivation

We need some large storage for data in the lab and provide university students for assignments, and etc.

## Building Sequences

### Installation OS

We install the OS, [OMV(OpenMediaVault)](https://www.openmediavault.org/) and version is `5.x`.

1. Enter https://www.openmediavault.org/

2. Enter [Download] in the URL

3. You can download a `.iso` file in the section [ISO]

   > the link is here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmediavault/files/

4. You can download any version

   > I downloaded the latest version, `5.5.11`

### Building Booting Disk

And then we need to build a booting disk using the installed `.iso` file.

#### Needs:

- USB
- OS File
- Building application for booting usb`

#### My system is below:

```bash
$ uname -a
Linux host 5.4.0-53-generic #59-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 21 09:38:44 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

1. I used the OS built-in application **Startup Disk Creation**
2. If you run the application, you can do it

### Install the OS in the NAS Server

There are good references for installing the OVM for the NAS Server. 

These are Koeran, so if you canâ€™t use the references, you can find other references in Google.
