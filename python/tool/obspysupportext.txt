Waveform Import/Export Plug-ins

Warning

In most cases these modules do not need to be called directly. They register via the central ObsPy read() function - call this instead.

Usage Example:

import obspy
# Format will be detected automatically.
st = obspy.read("/path/to/file")
# Many formats can also be written out - just use the module name.
st.write("/path/to/outfile", format="mseed")

Warning

In most cases these modules do not need to be called directly. They register via the central ObsPy read_inventory() function - call this instead.

Usage Example:

import obspy
# Format will be detected automatically.
inv = obspy.read_inventory("/path/to/file")
# Many formats can also be written out - just use the module name.
